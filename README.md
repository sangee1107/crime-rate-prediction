# crime-rate-prediction
Nowadays, crime is very common and happens everywhere in the cities. The act of committing a criminal offence is referred to as a crime. A person who does  this is called criminal. Although every crime is a violation of the law, but not every violation of the law is considered as a crime.Some cities in India had greater violent crime rates than the rest of the country.The major crimes in India are illegal drug trade, human trafficking, corruption ,violation against women, etc.We need to  take some steps to stop these crimes. The purpose of this study is to predict the crime rate using machine learning models such as k-means, KNN, Gradient boosting classifier.The Gradient boosting classifier has predicated the crime rate with an accuracy of  99.8%,and the K nearest neighbour algorithm has predicted with an accuracy of  98.5%.
